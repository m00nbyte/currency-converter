# Type can be
# - feat (new feature)
# - change (code change)
# - fix (bug fix)
# - refactor (refactoring production code)
# - style (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change)
# - docs (changes to documentation)
# - test (adding or refactoring tests; no production code change)
# - chore (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)
# - wip (work in progress commit to be squashed -- do not push!)\*\*

# [type] Short summary (72 chars or less)

# More detailed explanatory text. Wrap it to 72 characters. The blank
# line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
# the body entirely).

# Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed
# bug" or "Fixes bug." This convention matches up with commit messages
# generated by commands like git merge and git revert.

# Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

# - Bullet points are okay, too.
# - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, followed by a
# - single space. Use a hanging indent.
